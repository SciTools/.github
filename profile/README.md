# Open tools for the analysis and visualisation of Earth science data

SciTools is a collaborative effort to produce powerful Python-based open-source tools for Earth scientists. Initially started at the UK [Met Office](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/) in 2010, SciTools has grown into a diverse community of partners and collaborators from around the world. SciTools is responsible for the maintenance of a number of key packages such as Iris and Cartopy, and continues to develop new and innovative tools for the Earth scientist's toolkit.

## üì¶ Projects

### Cartopy

Cartopy is a Python package designed for geospatial data processing in order to produce maps and other geospatial data analyses.

Key features of cartopy are its object oriented projection definitions, and its ability to transform points, lines, vectors, polygons and images between those projections.

You will find cartopy especially useful for large area / small scale data, where Cartesian assumptions of spherical data traditionally break down.

### Iris

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SciTools/iris/main/docs/src/_static/iris-logo.svg" height="100">

The Iris package implements a data model to create a data abstraction layer which isolates analysis and visualisation code from data format specifics. The data model we have chosen is the CF Data Model. The implementation of this model we have called an Iris Cube.

Iris currently supports read/write access to a range of data formats, including (CF-)netCDF, GRIB, and PP; fundamental data manipulation operations, such as arithmetic, interpolation, and statistics; and a range of integrated plotting options.

### ‚úè Development

The Met Office remains the driving force behind SciTools and most of our projects; however, all the projects are fundamentally developed in the open. The direction of SciTools projects is decided by the community of developers; who are always eager for more people from different areas to contribute towards Iris, Cartopy and the wider SciTools ecosystem. All types of contribution are encouraged:

- üí¨ Participating in conversations on [discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions/collaborating-with-your-community-using-discussions/about-discussions) / [issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues) / [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)

- ‚úè Developing your own software that uses or augments SciTools software package(s)

Every SciTools repository has a team of _maintainers_ - developers with GitHub permissions to make changes to the codebase (typically via approving and merging pull requests). Maintainers do their best to respond to discussions / issues / pull requests and generally keep the repositories healthy. [Many of the SciTools repositories are discussed at regular Peloton meetings](https://github.com/orgs/SciTools/projects/13?pane=info).
