# Accessibility Statement

This content is hosted by GitHub, so many accessibility concerns (e.g. background colour, keyboard control, type-facing) are deferred to GitHub. Links to to GitHub's own accessibility pages are provided at the end of this page.

For concerns within the control of SciTools developers, the following efforts have been made to maximise accessibility, in line with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21):

- Clear, descriptive headings, with no skipping of heading levels.
- Explanations and/or links are provided for any obscure terminology.
- Use of plain-text links, rather than any form of 'button' (e.g. [shields.io](https://shields.io/)).
- Images include alt-text.
- Emojis, where used, are placed appropriately to not confuse screen readers.
- Descriptive links (as opposed to links saying "click here", for example).
- Bulleted lists and tables to provide clearer structure (as opposed to lists within paragraphs).
