# Accessibility Statement

## How GitHub maximises accessibility

This content is hosted by GitHub, so many accessibility concerns (e.g. background colour, keyboard control, type-facing) are deferred to the developers of the GitHub website itself. Below are some links to GitHub's own accessibility pages:

## How SciTools developers maximise accessibility in our GitHub text

'GitHub text': on GitHub our accessibility efforts are directed at text intended for rendering on GitHub - such as README files, issues, comments. GitHub also hosts other content that is not the subject of the statements here:

- Software code - plain text not designed for any rendering; readability is largely determined by the designers of the software language.
- Documentation code - plain text designed for rendering by a third party service (e.g. [Sphinx](https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx)), and hosting elsewhere. Should include its own dedicated accessibility statement.

For concerns within the control of SciTools developers - as opposed to the developers of GitHub - the following efforts have been made to maximise accessibility, in line with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21):

- Use of the simplest language possible for the topic, i.e. avoid 'flowery language'.
- Explanations and/or links are provided for any obscure terminology.
- Clear, descriptive headings, with no skipping of heading levels.
- Bulleted lists and tables to provide clearer structure (as opposed to lists within paragraphs).
- Tables of contents are provided for large bodies of text, to aid quick navigation.
- Descriptive links (as opposed to links saying "click here", for example).
- Punctuation and emojis are used with consideration for how a screen reader will interpet the text.
- Images include alt-text.
- Badges
  - E.g. [shields.io](https://shields.io/).
  - Are only used where dynamic content is needed.
  - Include alt-text.
  - Basic links instead use plain text wherever possible.
