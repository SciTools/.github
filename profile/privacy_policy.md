Privacy policy pending feedback from legal experts.

The below is adapted from the privacy policy at https://scitools.org.uk/privacy.html, updated having checked https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/policies/privacy. Edits are shown using ~~strikethrough~~ and <ins>underline</ins>.

- I can see that there are large text blocks missing when compared to the one on metoffice.gov.uk - I cannot tell if this is deviation over the passage of time, or whether these blocks are considered not applicable to our case?
- What is the correct way to reference GitHub's own privacy policies?
- What is the correct way to reference that the Contributor Licence Agreement is handled by a third party, which includes independent data storage?
  - [From the CLA](https://cla-assistant.io/SciTools/): "Your GitHub username will also be recorded on the CLA Assistant database to permit Developers of SciTools Projects to ascertain that your Contribution is covered by a signed CLA. Your Personal Data will be stored on a Cosmos DB (MongoDB compatible) database hosted on Microsoft Azure in Europe and owned by CLA Assistant. For further information, please see Microsoftâ€™s ðŸ”— Privacy Policy and ðŸ”— CLA Assistant on GitHub."
  - We also periodically download the data from the CLA onto Met Office machinery, just in case the service goes down.
